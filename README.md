# learning-COBOL
This is my directory for learning COBOL! I'll follow tutorials, cite them here, and put notes/documentation in the files. Will eventually put mini projects here, WIP.

## what is COBOL?
COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It's a simple, highly readable English-based programming language for admin systems. It was officially standardized in 1968, but COBOL is still widely used in admin systems for companies and governments.

COBOL powers up to 80% of financial transactions, 60 million healthcare services, and 71% of fortune 500 backends. It's super old but literally everywhere. Despite this, it's somewhat obscure and there are fewer resources for learning the language. 

Because COBOL is foundational to a ton of crucial digital infrastructure, I thought it'd be cool to learn. I'll put small programs and projects here, documenting my learning in comments as I go.
